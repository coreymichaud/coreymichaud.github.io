# Hey!

My name's Corey Michaud. I recently graduated from the University of Central Florida with a B.S. in Statistics. I love using statistics, along with coding, to solve real world problems and create visualizations to better understand and explain data. When I'm not active on a computer, I like to spend time watching movies (theaters make it even better), trying new restaurants with my girlfriend, and playing with our 2 cats, Gnocchi and Ube.
