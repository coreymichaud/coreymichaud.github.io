Welcome to my blog, *The Statosphere*. Currently, this is a place where I can write while I do a lot of self-study on, but not limited to, statistics, machine learning, and various fields of mathematics. Hopefully by writing in a bloggy way, I can help myself learn while teaching you something new or interesting. So put your reading glasses on and get ready to enter The Statosphere.
