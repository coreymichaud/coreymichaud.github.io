    "section": "",
    "text": "Analysis of the American Industrial Revolution\nThe American Industrial Revolution, spanning roughly from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, was a period of profound economic, social, and technological transformation. This era marked the transition from agrarian economies to industrialized and urbanized societies. Several key factors contributed to this transformation, each playing a pivotal role in reshaping the United States.\n\nKey Drivers and Innovations\nTechnological Advancements\nThe introduction of mechanized textile production was a significant factor. Samuel Slater, known as the “Father of the American Industrial Revolution,” brought British textile technology to America, establishing the first successful textile mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1793. The development of steam engines by innovators like James Watt revolutionized transportation and manufacturing. Steam-powered locomotives and boats facilitated faster movement of goods and people, effectively shrinking the vast American landscape. Pioneered by Eli Whitney, the concept of interchangeable parts in manufacturing standardized production and significantly increased efficiency, laying the groundwork for mass production.\nTransportation Infrastructure\nThe construction of canals, such as the Erie Canal (completed in 1825), and the expansion of the railroad network connected regional markets and resources, lowering transportation costs and spurring economic growth. Improved roadways facilitated better movement of goods and people within the country, promoting regional trade and commerce.\nUrbanization and Labor\nThe population boom, fueled by both natural increase and immigration, provided a steady supply of labor for factories and industrial enterprises. Cities grew around industrial hubs, with places like Lowell, Massachusetts, becoming models of industrial communities. Urbanization brought about new social dynamics, including the rise of a distinct working class.\nCapital and Investment\nThe establishment of a robust banking system provided the necessary capital for industrial ventures. The availability of credit and investment opportunities spurred entrepreneurial activities and industrial expansion. Protective tariffs and supportive government policies helped nurture American industries by shielding them from foreign competition and encouraging domestic production.\n\n\nEconomic and Social Impact\nEconomic Growth\nThe American Industrial Revolution led to unprecedented economic growth. The shift from agrarian to industrial economies increased productivity, diversified the economy, and boosted the national GDP. The rise of factories created numerous jobs, attracting rural populations to urban centers and fostering a consumer culture driven by new goods and services.\nSocial Changes\nThe harsh working conditions in factories gave rise to labor movements advocating for better wages, working hours, and conditions. This period saw the emergence of trade unions and labor strikes. Women and children played significant roles in the workforce, particularly in textile mills. This involvement began shifting traditional gender roles and highlighted the need for labor reforms.\nEnvironmental Impact\nIndustrialization brought significant environmental changes, including deforestation, pollution, and changes in land use. The exploitation of natural resources raised concerns about sustainability and environmental degradation.\nTechnological and Scientific Advancements\nThe industrial revolution spurred technological innovation and scientific discovery. Advances in metallurgy, chemistry, and engineering had far-reaching effects beyond industry, influencing agriculture, medicine, and everyday life.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe American Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for the United States’ emergence as a global economic power. It transformed the social fabric, economic landscape, and technological capabilities of the nation. The lessons learned from this era, including the importance of innovation, infrastructure, labor rights, and environmental stewardship, continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about economic development and industrialization.\nWhile the Industrial Revolution brought about significant progress and prosperity, it also posed challenges that required societal adaptation and regulatory measures. Understanding this complex period is crucial for appreciating the dynamics of modern industrial economies and addressing the ongoing impacts of industrialization in the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{michaud2024,\n  author = {Michaud, Corey},\n  title = {The {American} {Industrial} {Revolution}},\n  date = {2024-06-27},\n  url = {https://coreymichaud.github.io/blog/06-27-24-Industrial-Revolution/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMichaud, Corey. 2024. “The American Industrial Revolution.”\nJune 27, 2024. https://coreymichaud.github.io/blog/06-27-24-Industrial-Revolution/."

    "text": "Source Code\n\nBackground\nAlzheimer’s is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is caused by increasing age, and primarily affects people above the age of 65. As a person develops Alzheimer’s, it progressively becomes worse where the individual can lose the ability to carry a conversation or even take care of themselves. After diagnosis, a person can expect to live on average between 4 to 8 years, but on better cases up to 20 years. Luckily there is medication to help slow the worsening of Alzheimer’s, but nothing to completely prevent it from happening.\nThe data used for the detection of Alzheimer’s through handwriting comes from the DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset. This dataset is made up of 174 individual’s handwriting where roughly half are Alzheimer’s patients (P), and healthy people (H). The handwriting was taken through tasks the individuals were asked to do, and then variables like time in air were measured. In doing so, the creators of the DARWIN dataset provided us the materials we need to use machine learning techniques to detect the early stages of Alzheimer’s through handwriting. Some of the tasks recorded were connecting points through lines and copying phrases that were written in front of them, all of which test different parts of the brain.\nUsing handwriting data, I will use a random forest classifier to predict whether an individual has Alzheimer’s or not. The goal is for future handwriting data to be inserted and accurately predict the correct diagnosis, saving the individual time to get treatment to slow down the process.\nAlzheimers detection dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/handwriting-data-to-detect-alzheimers-disease.\n\n# Libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\n# Loading data\nalz = pd.read_csv(\"alzheimers.csv\")\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\n# First 5 rows of data\nalz.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nair_time1\ndisp_index1\ngmrt_in_air1\ngmrt_on_paper1\nmax_x_extension1\nmax_y_extension1\nmean_acc_in_air1\nmean_acc_on_paper1\nmean_gmrt1\n...\nmean_jerk_in_air25\nmean_jerk_on_paper25\nmean_speed_in_air25\nmean_speed_on_paper25\nnum_of_pendown25\npaper_time25\npressure_mean25\npressure_var25\ntotal_time25\nclass\n\n\n\n\n0\nid_1\n5160\n0.000013\n120.804174\n86.853334\n957\n6601\n0.361800\n0.217459\n103.828754\n...\n0.141434\n0.024471\n5.596487\n3.184589\n71\n40120\n1749.278166\n296102.7676\n144605\nP\n\n\n1\nid_2\n51980\n0.000016\n115.318238\n83.448681\n1694\n6998\n0.272513\n0.144880\n99.383459\n...\n0.049663\n0.018368\n1.665973\n0.950249\n129\n126700\n1504.768272\n278744.2850\n298640\nP\n\n\n2\nid_3\n2600\n0.000010\n229.933997\n172.761858\n2333\n5802\n0.387020\n0.181342\n201.347928\n...\n0.178194\n0.017174\n4.000781\n2.392521\n74\n45480\n1431.443492\n144411.7055\n79025\nP\n\n\n3\nid_4\n2130\n0.000010\n369.403342\n183.193104\n1756\n8159\n0.556879\n0.164502\n276.298223\n...\n0.113905\n0.019860\n4.206746\n1.613522\n123\n67945\n1465.843329\n230184.7154\n181220\nP\n\n\n4\nid_5\n2310\n0.000007\n257.997131\n111.275889\n987\n4732\n0.266077\n0.145104\n184.636510\n...\n0.121782\n0.020872\n3.319036\n1.680629\n92\n37285\n1841.702561\n158290.0255\n72575\nP\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 452 columns\n\n\n\n\n# Shape of data\nalz.shape\n\n(174, 452)\n\n\n\n# Data information\nalz.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 174 entries, 0 to 173\nColumns: 452 entries, ID to class\ndtypes: float64(300), int64(150), object(2)\nmemory usage: 614.6+ KB\n\n\n\n# Checking for object column names\nalz.select_dtypes(include = \"object\").columns.tolist()\n\n['ID', 'class']\n\n\n\n# Checking for missing values\nalz.isna().sum() # No NA values\n\nID                 0\nair_time1          0\ndisp_index1        0\ngmrt_in_air1       0\ngmrt_on_paper1     0\n                  ..\npaper_time25       0\npressure_mean25    0\npressure_var25     0\ntotal_time25       0\nclass              0\nLength: 452, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nFeature Engineering\n\n# Removing ID column\nalz = alz.drop(\"ID\", axis = 1)\nalz.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nair_time1\ndisp_index1\ngmrt_in_air1\ngmrt_on_paper1\nmax_x_extension1\nmax_y_extension1\nmean_acc_in_air1\nmean_acc_on_paper1\nmean_gmrt1\nmean_jerk_in_air1\n...\nmean_jerk_in_air25\nmean_jerk_on_paper25\nmean_speed_in_air25\nmean_speed_on_paper25\nnum_of_pendown25\npaper_time25\npressure_mean25\npressure_var25\ntotal_time25\nclass\n\n\n\n\n0\n5160\n0.000013\n120.804174\n86.853334\n957\n6601\n0.361800\n0.217459\n103.828754\n0.051836\n...\n0.141434\n0.024471\n5.596487\n3.184589\n71\n40120\n1749.278166\n296102.7676\n144605\nP\n\n\n1\n51980\n0.000016\n115.318238\n83.448681\n1694\n6998\n0.272513\n0.144880\n99.383459\n0.039827\n...\n0.049663\n0.018368\n1.665973\n0.950249\n129\n126700\n1504.768272\n278744.2850\n298640\nP\n\n\n2\n2600\n0.000010\n229.933997\n172.761858\n2333\n5802\n0.387020\n0.181342\n201.347928\n0.064220\n...\n0.178194\n0.017174\n4.000781\n2.392521\n74\n45480\n1431.443492\n144411.7055\n79025\nP\n\n\n3\n2130\n0.000010\n369.403342\n183.193104\n1756\n8159\n0.556879\n0.164502\n276.298223\n0.090408\n...\n0.113905\n0.019860\n4.206746\n1.613522\n123\n67945\n1465.843329\n230184.7154\n181220\nP\n\n\n4\n2310\n0.000007\n257.997131\n111.275889\n987\n4732\n0.266077\n0.145104\n184.636510\n0.037528\n...\n0.121782\n0.020872\n3.319036\n1.680629\n92\n37285\n1841.702561\n158290.0255\n72575\nP\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 451 columns\n\n\n\n\n# Converting class to numeric\nalz[\"class\"] = alz[\"class\"].replace({'P': 1, 'H': 0})\nalz[\"class\"]\n\nC:\\Users\\cor3y\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_14760\\2961317950.py:2: FutureWarning: Downcasting behavior in `replace` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
